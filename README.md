This project should display the use of background images and gradiants. Besides gradiants and images, I used CSS-grid to created the structure of the page,
flex-box and floats to position individual smaller sections. Navigation is actually a form with, button, and 8 input elements(7 of type button, 1 of type search).

Built With:
HTML,
CSS
